# Be Thoughtful

## Reding

    Begin thoughtful simply means think of others before yourself. Whatever you say or do will have an effect on others. So it is important that you think berfore you say or do anything. In this way, you can avoid hurting other's feelings. Moreover, a thoughtless act or remark can spoil a perfact relationship. 

    Remember these rules. If you don't have anything nice to say, dont't say anything. Likewise, if you think what you do will hurt others, dont't do it. After all, what goes around comes around.
