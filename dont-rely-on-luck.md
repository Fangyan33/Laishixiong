# Don't Rely on Luck

## Text

Passing exam is every student's drems. Failing them is their nightmare. So, to realize their dreams, many studnts try anything. They even go to fortunetellers, buy lucky charms and follow old customs.  

In Korea, many students bury something personal in the University they want enter. They believe that these things will act as magnets and "pull" them into the university. Whether it work or not, nobody really knows. At least it does ease the students' minds about passing exams. Rember, though, you can't always rely on luck. There is no substitute for hard work.

## Grammar Points

#### to + 原形动词 不定式短语作副词用，表示目的

So, **to realize their dreams**, many students try anything.

to realize 为不定时短语，做副词用，修饰全句。

可放在句首或者句尾，用以表示目的，翻译为 “为了（要）……” 

句首时，后面用逗号连接主句：
To success in life, you must be determined.

句尾，不需要逗号：
Peter left home early to avoid the heavy traffic. 

> 表示目的的不定式短语可用下列短语取代
order to + 原形动词
so as to + 原形动词
with a view to + 动名词 （to 在这里是介词，所以要用动名词）
with an eye to + 动名词（to 在这里是介词，所以要用动名词）

> 除了 so as to 须置于句尾外，其余即可放在句首也可以放在句尾

> 例：
> 句尾：
* Ron is saving money to buy a house.  
* Ron is saving money order to buy a house.
* Ron is saving money so as to buy a house.
* Ron is saving money with a view to buying a house.
* Ron is saving money with a eye to buying a house.

> 句首：
* To buy a house, Ron is saving money.
* To buy a house, Ron is saving money. 
* with a view to buying a house, Ron is saving money.
* With a eye to buying a house, Ron is saving money.
* ~~So as to buy a house, Ron is saving money.~~ （X）

#### whether 名词从句

Whether it works or not, nobody really knows.
= Nobody really knows whether it works or not. 

Whether it works or not 为名词从句做 know 的宾语，whether 从句放在句首表示强调。

> Whether 从句后面有 or not 时，可以将其放在 whether 后面
* Whether or not it works, nobody really knows. 
* Nobody reallay knows whether or not it works.
