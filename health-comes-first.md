# Health Comes First

## Text

Smoking is bad that it is harmful to one's health. In spite of fact that doctors have even warned that it causes cancer, people still keep on smoking.

In some Western countries, however, people are begining to kick of the bad habit. They realize that health should come first. To help them quit smoking, there are laws against cigarette advertising and smoking in public place. This is praiseworthy except that Western countries are now selling cigarettes in the East in greater numbers than ever. That they are doing is in immoral, don't you think.
