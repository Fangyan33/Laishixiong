# Health Comes First

## Text
Smoking is bad that it is harmful to one's health. In spite of fact that doctors have even warned that it causes cancer, people still keep on smoking.

In some Western countries, however, people are begining to kick of the bad habit. They realize that health should come first. To help them quit smoking, there are laws against cigarette advertising and smoking in public place. This is praiseworthy except that Western countries are now selling cigarettes in the East in greater numbers than ever. That they are doing is in immoral, don't you think.

## Grammar Points

#### in that 

Smoking is bed **in that** it is harmful to one's health.  

这里 **in that** 为【副词连词】，而不是“(介词) in + that 从句”，这里相当于 because 的意思。

in that 与 because 区别：
in that 一般放在主句之后，不是句首。
because 可放在主句句首，主从之间中间用逗号隔开。也可放在主句句尾不加逗号
