# Health Comes First

## Text
Smoking is bad that it is harmful to one's health. In spite of fact that doctors have even warned that it causes cancer, people still keep on smoking.

In some Western countries, however, people are begining to kick of the bad habit. They realize that health should come first. To help them quit smoking, there are laws against cigarette advertising and smoking in public place. This is praiseworthy except that Western countries are now selling cigarettes in the East in greater numbers than ever. That they are doing is in immoral, don't you think.

## Grammar Points

#### in that 

Smoking is bed **in that** it is harmful to one's health.  

这里 **in that** 为【副词连词】，而不是“(介词) in + that 从句”，这里相当于 because 的意思。in that 与 because 区别：
in that 一般放在主句之后，不是句首。
because 可放在主句句首，主从之间中间用逗号隔开。也可放在主句句尾不加逗号

* Jogging is good for you in that it helps you keep fit.  
  （慢跑对你来说很好，因为它有助于保持身体健康。）

* Because he is so shy, he seldom goes out with girls. 
  (因为他很害羞，所以很少和女孩出去)
  = He seldom goes out with girls because he is so shy.  

#### 介词 + the fact + that 从句

**In spite of the fact that** dotcors have even warned that it causes cancer, people still keep on smoking.  

in spite of ...  尽管/虽然……  
 = despite ... prep. 
 
1. 上述句子中的 in spite of 是【短语介词】（即多个单词形成的介词），despite 是介词。
2. 因为that 引导的名词从句不可以作介词的宾语，所以在in spite of 后面加 the fact 作为宾语，然后再接that 从句
3. 最后接 that 从句

例句：

* In spite of woking two jobs, Mr. Chen can hardly make ends meet.  
   = Despite working two jobs, Mr. Chen can hardly makes ends meet.
   (尽管兼了两份工作，陈先生依然入不敷出)
* **In spite of that** I lent my friend US$1 million, his company went bankrupt.  (X)
