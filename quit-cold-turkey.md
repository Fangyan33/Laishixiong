## Key Points

#### quit cold turkey  断然戒烟

quit 为不及物动词这里表示戒掉；"quit turkey" 原为名词，表示冷火鸡，在此做副词用表示断然的，一次彻底的

例：Trying to quit smoking slowly doesn't work. you've got to quit cold turkey.  

#### promise  vt. 允诺；n. 诺言

promise + (人) + that   答应某人做某事
promise + (人) + to + 原型动词  答应某人做某事
make a promise to + 原型动词

例: 
* Andy promised teacher that he wouldn't cut class again. 

* The worker make a promise to be on time for work in future.  

#### I really want to except that...

相当于 I really want to ~~give up smoking~~ except that...

except 是介词，与 that 并用可看做成连词，表示 “但是，只不过”的意思。

#### nervous a.  紧张的

The nervous tennis player eventually lost the game.

#### can't help + doing 禁不住，忍不住

= can't resist + doing  （resist 抗拒）
= can't help but + 动词原型

例：
* My sister **can't help biting** her fingernails when she gets nervous. 

* My sister **can't resist biting** her fingernails when she gets nervous. 

* My sister **can't help but bit** her fingernails when she gets nervous.
