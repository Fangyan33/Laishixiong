## Power Without Pollution

Pollution is a big problem in almost all the big cities of the world. City people are, therefore, becoming more and more worried about how they can get rid of pollution. They also concerned whether the government is doing enough to protect the environment.

However, people in Ireland don't have these worries. They are sure that they have found the answer to the problem. They use windmills. These windmills can create power without creating pollution. This method so is successful that other countries are thinking of doing the same. Why not? What works for Ireland can works for other countries.

### Grammar Points.

* pollution is a big problem in **almost all** the big cities of the world.       
  almost 用来修饰形容词或副词时，这些词必需具有 【完全】 的概念，所以 all, any, every, no 等都可以与almost 并用，但没有almost most 或者 almost many 的用法，因为most 或many 只表示部分，没有完全的概念。     例: Almost many sailors are good swimmers. \(x\)           Almost all sailors are good swimmers. \(√\)           Almost every school has a basketball court. \(√\)     almost 与 always 并用时需置于前。     例: My father is almost always in a good mood. \(我父亲几乎总是心情很好\)

* City people are, therefore, becoming more an more worried **about how they can get rid of pollution**.     They are also concerned **about wether the government is doing enougth to protect environment**.     how 与wether 引导的名词从句分别作介词about 的宾语。     例: The professor spoke on how we should behave at job interview.

* They are sure that they found **the answer to the problem**.     有些名词固定要与to 并用，主要是此类名词通常表示“针对“ 的意思。常见的有key，answer，road，solution等。     the key of the room \(x\) -&gt; the key to room \(√\)     the key of success \(x\) -&gt; the key to success \(√\)     the road of victory \(x\) -&gt; the road to victory \(√\)     the answer/solution of problem \(x\) -&gt; the answer/solution to problem \(√\)

* This method is so successful that other countries are thinking of doing the same.     doing the same = doing the same thing. same 本来是形容词但在本句中做代词用，其后省略了名词thing     so + adj./adv. + that ...    如此……以至于……     such + n. + that ...    如此……以至于……     It's so hot that we can't do without an air conditioner.  （天气太热了，以至于我们少不了空调。）     He is such a genius that he doesn't have to study much for exams. \(他是一个天才，所以他考试都不用怎么学习。\)
